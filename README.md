# 📊 MTN Nigeria Customer Churn & Usage Analysis (Q1 2025)
##  Project Overview  
This project explores **customer churn and usage behavior** among MTN Nigeria users during the first quarter of 2025.  
As part of my data analytics journey, I wanted to understand **why customers leave** and **what drives loyalty** in the telecom industry.

Using Power BI, I designed a dashboard that highlights churn patterns, customer behavior, and usage trends across demographics, subscription plans, and device types.
